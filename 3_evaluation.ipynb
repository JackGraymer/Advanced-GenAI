Both the reference and generated answers are embedded using a pretrained sentence transformer (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`). Cosine similarity is then calculated between each answer pair to measure their semantic closeness. The resulting similarity score is stored in the `semantic_similarity` column, and a binary `semantic_match` flag is set based on a chosen threshold (e.g., ≥ 0.50). This approach captures whether two answers convey the same meaning, even if they use different wording, making it ideal for evaluating generative models like RAG."

        "To compute the semantic F1 score, both the reference and generated answers are tokenized into words or short spans. Instead of requiring exact token matches, each token is embedded using a sentence embedding model (such as `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`). For each token in the generated answer, the most similar token in the reference answer is identified using cosine similarity. If the similarity exceeds a threshold (e.g., 0.7), it is counted as a match. Semantic precision is defined as the fraction of generated tokens that have a semantically similar match in the reference; semantic recall is the fraction of reference tokens matched by the generated answer. The semantic F1 score is the harmonic mean of these two. This approach is robust to paraphrasing and lexical variation, providing a more nuanced evaluation than strict token overlap."

        "\n",
        "To further evaluate the quality of RAG-generated answers, BLEU and ROUGE scores are computed as standard metrics for measuring string overlap between generated and reference texts. BLEU emphasizes n-gram precision, reflecting the extent to which the generated answer matches the reference answer at the word or phrase level. ROUGE offers several variants—ROUGE-1 (unigram overlap), ROUGE-2 (bigram overlap), and ROUGE-L (longest common subsequence)—to capture both exact word matches and longer sequence similarities. Although these metrics do not directly assess semantic meaning, they provide valuable insight into the lexical similarity and coverage of the generated responses relative to the ground truth. The resulting scores are stored in the DataFrame columns `bleu`, `rouge1`, `rouge2`, and `rougeL`, facilitating quantitative comparison of answer quality across the dataset."
